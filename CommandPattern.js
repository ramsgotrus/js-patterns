/* Command Pattern : with command pattern , we can decouple objects
 that execute certain task from the object that calls the method. */

/* Pros
The command pattern allows us to decouple methods from the object that executes the operation. It gives you more control if youâ€™re dealing with commands that have a certain lifespan, or commands that should be queued and executed at specific times.

Cons
The use cases for the command pattern are quite limited, and often adds unnecessary boilerplate to an application */
